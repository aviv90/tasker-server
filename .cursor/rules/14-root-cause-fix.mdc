# Root Cause Fix Rule

All bugs and issues MUST be solved from the root cause.

## Requirements
1.  **Deep Investigation**: Do not just fix the symptom. Understand WHY the issue occurred.
2.  **No Band-Aids**: Do NOT apply temporary fixes, "plasters", or fragile heuristics (like crude regexes) unless explicitly requested as a temporary measure.
3.  **Cross-Cutting**: Verify if the root cause affects other parts of the system and fix it widely.
4.  **Robustness**: The fix must be durable and align with the system's architecture (e.g., using SSOT, correct data flow).

## Process
1.  **Analyze**: Look at logs, reproduce the issue, trace the execution.
2.  **Identify**: Pinpoint the exact failure point logic.
3.  **Fix**: Rewrite or adjust the core logic causing the failure.
4.  **Verify**: Ensure the fix works and doesn't break other things.

**Example**:
*   *Bad*: Adding a specific regex to ignore a specific bad input.
*   *Good*: Fixing the input parsing logic or history handling so the bad input is handled correctly by design.
